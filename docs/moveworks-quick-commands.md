4. Integrate with reasoning loops for deterministic checking
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update tracker with completed work
```

### **ðŸ”„ Progress & Updates**

```
Update the Moveworks project tracker documents with completed work:
1. Mark completed action items as done
2. Update progress percentages
3. Note any new issues or blockers discovered
4. Identify next priority items
5. Update effort estimates if needed
```

```
Review the Moveworks implementation progress and provide:
