# Moveworks Agentic Reasoning Engine - Complete Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Moveworks Agentic Reasoning Engine based on official documentation. Each component has been analyzed separately and documented in linked files for better organization and maintainability.

## Architecture Components

The Moveworks Agentic Reasoning Engine consists of the following interconnected components:

### ✅ Completed Analysis

1. **[Memory Constructs](./memory-constructs.md)** - Four types of memory for complete knowledge and context
2. **[Reasoning Loops](./reasoning-loops.md)** - Three interconnected loops for solution exploration
3. **[Plugin Selection](./plugin-selection.md)** - Autonomous plugin determination and execution

### ❌ Pending Analysis

4. **Conversational Context** - Context management and behavior framework
5. **Guardrails** - Safety and constraint mechanisms  
6. **Grounding and Hallucinations** - Truth grounding and hallucination prevention
7. **Continuous Learning** - Learning and adaptation mechanisms
8. **LLMs & SLMs** - Language model integration and selection
9. **Steerability Tools** - Control and steering mechanisms

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Fundamental Architecture Mismatch**: Our implementation doesn't follow Moveworks patterns
2. **Extensive Hardcoded Values**: Multiple configuration values are hardcoded instead of configurable
3. **Missing Core Components**: Variable tracking framework, reference grounding, multi-plugin support
4. **Incorrect Data Structures**: Database schema doesn't match Moveworks memory patterns

### Hardcoded Values Found
```python
max_planning_iterations = 3      # Should be configurable
max_execution_steps = 5          # Should be configurable  
response_timeout = 30.0          # Should be configurable
domain: str = "GENERAL_DOMAIN"   # Should be dynamic from database
max_messages = 20                # Should be configurable 6-20 range
```

### Missing Moveworks Components
- **Variable Tracking Framework** for business object integrity
- **Reference Grounding System** for fact verification
- **Three-Loop Architecture** with proper planner/evaluator separation
- **Multi-Plugin Response** capability
- **Plugin Competition Resolution** mechanisms

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Issues | Priority |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Memory Constructs | ❌ Major Issues | Wrong architecture, hardcoded values | High |
| Reasoning Loops | ❌ Major Issues | Missing three-loop pattern | High |
| Plugin Selection | ❌ Not Implemented | No autonomous selection | High |
| Conversational Context | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | Medium |
| Guardrails | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | High |
| Grounding & Hallucinations | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | High |
| Continuous Learning | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | Medium |
| LLMs & SLMs | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | Medium |
| Steerability Tools | ❌ Pending Analysis | Unknown | Medium |

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Complete Documentation (Current)
- Finish analyzing all 9 components
- Document each component in separate linked files
- Identify all hardcoded values and architectural issues

### Phase 2: Architecture Planning
- Design complete rebuild based on actual Moveworks patterns
- Plan database schema changes
- Design configuration-driven approach

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Implement proper Moveworks architecture
- Remove all hardcoded values
- Add missing core components

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Documentation**: Complete analysis of remaining 6 components
2. **Avoid Code Changes**: Don't modify code until complete understanding achieved
3. **Plan Rebuild**: Design complete architecture overhaul based on findings
